<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%">My study
analyzed the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the United States
from 2000 to 2020. The results show that ASD has consistently increased during
this period, from an estimated <span style="color:red">1 in 150 </span>children
in 2006 to <span style="color:red">1 in 54 </span>in 2020. The highest increase
occurred in 2008 due to a change in diagnostic criteria. Additionally, for
every female with ASD, there are four males with the disorder. These
findings are important for understanding the distribution and trends of ASD in
the country.&nbsp; In addition, the total
population increase year to year was less and or equal to the Autism (ASD) Population
increase for every year. This indicates a potential economic development factor
as services needed for ASD are not cheap.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%"><o:p><br></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%"><o:p><br></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1229/1/1.jpg" style="width: 50%;"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%"><o:p><br></o:p></span></p>
