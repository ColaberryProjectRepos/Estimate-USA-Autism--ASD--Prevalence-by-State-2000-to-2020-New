
Problem Encountered

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%">1. The first
problem I encountered was identifying a dataset. I wanted to find one that can
give me detailed information on ASD prevalence in each state from 2000 to
2020.&nbsp; The only way I could do this was to combine data from different sources to create a master data table.&nbsp; This took lots of time to research gather the
data and transform the information available to create a dataset that can tell
a story.&nbsp; I had to use knowledge from my
ETL training to create an Excel Dataset Table.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%">2. Another
issue was Creating DAX Formulas to produce the measures in order to make sense
of the data. I made corrections numerous times, which helped to come up with
the right formulas and also increase my knowledge of DAX.<br>
<br>
3. The final challenge I had was to make the project visually appealing.&nbsp; Proper color selection for the KPI information
as well as the sub-KPI data information.&nbsp;
The colors had to match the story.&nbsp;
I learned the importance of Color selection, size, etc. is very important
to create an appealing project visual</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%"><br></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1229/4/1.jpg" style="width: 50%;"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%"><br></span></p>
